    know_how_faq:
      also_consider_that_wind_chill: Also, consider that wind chill is a significant factor in a hammock. Pitch the 90 Degree Hammock Tarp-Tent low and close the doors to best keep out the wind, if needed.
      also_in_the_outdoors: Also in the outdoors you want to stay dry. Use our 90 Degree Tarp-Tent, and pitch it prior to the hammock if it is raining already.

      click_on_a_topic_to_expand_its_contents: Click on a topic to expand its contents.
      consider_that_insulation_from_underneath: Consider that insulation from underneath is equally or more important in a hammock than your topside insulation (sleeping bag or quilt).
      expeds_hammock_suspension_kit: Exped's Hammock Suspension Kit and Drip Clips is one recommended alternative.
      go_with_the_90_degree_hammock_gamma_ul_html: Go with the 90 Degree Hammock Gamma UL and consider going without a camping pad. You can use your emptied backpack (or back padding only, if it is removable, such as on the ULA Epic) together with your down jacket and possibly other clothing as insulation material inside the pad-sleeve. This way you do not have to carry any additional items for insulation besides what you carry anyway. See %{pct_trail_journal} for more information on this, and test before you head out.

      headline: Frequently Asked Questions
      how_can_i_reduce_my_pack_weight: How can I reduce my pack weight the most on a backpacking trip using a 90 Degree Hammock?
      how_can_i_sleep_overnight_in_a_90_degree_hammock: How can I sleep overnight in a 90 Degree Hammock?
      how_can_i_stay_dry: How can I stay dry in the 90 Degree Hammock with a 90 Degree Tarp-Tent?
      how_cold_is_too_cold: How cold is too cold? Can I camp in a 90 Degree Hammock in the winter?
      how_long_is_the_warranty_period: How long is the warranty period on HammockTent products?
      i_bought_some_hammocktent_products: I bought some HammockTent products and I'm not happy with them. Can I return them?
      i_cant_get_the_bug_net_zipper: I can't get the bug-net zipper slider around those curves
      i_dont_like_the_hammock_suspension: I don't like the hammock suspension with the descender rings. Are there any other methods to hang the 90 Degree Hammock?
      i_have_a_hard_time: I have a hard time to get the descender rings off the ropes
      i_have_damaged_hammocktent_products: I have damaged HammockTent products. Do you do repairs?
      i_have_used_the_hammock: I have used the hammock and now I can see stitching holes that have opened up. Are the seams about to fail? Will the fabric rip?
      i_sometimes_slowly_slide: I sometimes slowly slide towards the foot-end during sleep
      if_hanged_on_a_single_overhead_point: If hanged on a single overhead point you may want to find a way to stop the hammock from rotating.
      if_i_insert_a_full_length_pad: If I insert a full length pad into the hammock or its pad-sleeve I have troubles getting inside.
      if_it_is_stormy: If it is stormy, use the 90 Degree Tarp-Tent doors for all around protection, and pitch it low and close around the hammock, making sure it does not touch it anywhere. Also, water can run down the suspension cords and may in some circumstances not drip off completely at the descender rings. In this case, add a little piece of string as a drip line right below the de-scender rings. A drip line is the most effective way to prevent any water running down the suspension into your hammock.
      im_only_1_9_m_tall: I'm only 1.9 m tall, but the hammock is too short since I touch it with my head and my feet
      in_the_outdoors_consider_that_a_hammock: In the outdoors, consider that a hammock is not an all enclosed shelter (even if you use your Tarp-Tent) and that you therefore need stuff just a little bit warmer.
      in_the_tropics: In the tropics (with nighttime temperatures of above 28° C / 82° F) mosquito proofness is more of a concern. Not only could you get mosquitos carrying diseases, you'd also find that a model with a pad-sleeve, as well as a sleeping bag and long sleeved sleep wear, is way too hot. Therefore, if you intend to use a single layered 90 Degree Hammock in the tropics, we recommend you consider additional mosquito proofing measures such as these
      in_the_tropics_a_hammock_with_a_pad_sleeve: In the tropics a hammock with a pad-sleeve or any other insulation is generally too hot. There you may want to go with one of the single layered 90 Degree Hammocks; however, these are not mosquito proof, unless additional measures are taken (see below).
      is_the_90_degree_hammock_mosquito_proof: Is the 90 Degree Hammock mosquito proof?
      it_can_be_a_little_bit_tricky: 'It can be a little bit tricky, but try it this way: pull the loose end of the rope to raise the rings a little bit first, or feed the tree side rope back through the rings a bit, so as to loosen them up. Then spread them and unthread the loose end from in between the rings.'
      it_is_normal_that_stitching: It is normal that stitching holes open up a little bit once the seams have been under pressure (aka seam slippage). This does not mean that the fabric is about to rip. It will retain 100% of its original strength, as the fibers are only shifted a bit within the architecture of the fabric and are not broken. This is no damage, and the seams will not fail or come apart. It is an esthetic issue at the most, which is a trade-off for using thin and lightweight fabrics.
      its_generally_better: It's generally better if you can have a spacing of at least 1m (3ft) between hanging points.
      its_much_more_comfortable_for_you: It's much more comfortable for you if you insert a pad into the pad-sleeve. If you just lay a pad into the hammock you sometimes fall off it or it shifts underneath yourself and does not stay in its desired position.
      no_but_you_can_carefully_clean_it: No, but you can carefully clean it with cold water and a cloth.
      on_a_concluding_note: On a concluding note, the recommended spacing between hanging points for the hammock is 2 to 5.5m (6 to 18ft). If you sacrifice some of its comfort and functionality spacings of 0 to 6 m (0 to 20ft) are possible.
      please_write_us_an_email: Please write us an email and we'll give you an address where you can send them to.
      quality_issues_troubles_care: Quality issues, troubles, care
      returns_warranty_refunds_repairs: Returns, warranty, refunds, repairs
      sew_on_a_bug_net_cover: Sew on a bug-net cover, enclosing the underside of the hammock without touching it.
      spread_your_legs: Spread your legs and pull the pad / hammock through the middle of your legs a bit, until you can sit down in the center of the hammock. It's easy! Alternatively you can stand a little bit to the side of the hammock (where the zipper opens the bug-net a bit further), and enter from the side. Or, if you sacrifice a little bit of comfort, use a shorter pad (one that covers your shoulders and your butt only, which is where you really need it). This is a good way to save some weight, as well.
      the_90_degree_hammocks_with_pad_sleeve: The 90 Degree Hammocks with pad-sleeve are designed for use outside of the tropics, where you usually get somewhat cooler nighttime temperatures requiring a sleeping bag and most likely some sort of insulation underneath.
      the_descender_rings_seem: The descender rings seem to damage the suspension ropes
      the_fabric_is_fraying: The fabric is fraying in some places and now I have annoying fibers getting in the way!
      the_hammocks_are_designed: The hammocks are designed to keep an average person horizontally. Depending on your build, however, you might have a center of gravity slightly closer to your feet. In this case your head will be a little bit higher than your feet and there will be a tendency for sliding downslope to-wards your feet. Just gently straighten your legs and push yourself up to the head-end of the hammock.
      the_models_with_bug_net: The models with bug-net come with two storage pouches. Besides, more storage pouches / stuff bags could easily be attached on the ridgeline or the suspension strings, as goes for your shoes, wet socks and the like. Also, you could hang your backpack onto one of the suspension cords to get it off the wet ground and out of reach from critters.
      the_shape_of_the_hammock: The shape of the hammock and its slight curve are determined by various factors. Rest assured that it is as flat as you want it, also for sleeping on your side, and as comfortable as it possibly gets the way it is designed.
      the_sleeping_area_can_feel_more_confined: The sleeping area can feel more confined. This can be alleviated to some degree by using a pad inside the pad-sleeve (or in the hammock). If hanged on one overhead point it may also be spread by a bar.
      the_straps_work_with_trees: The straps work with trees of 34 cm (13'') diameter or less. With thicker trees, avoid having the rope next to tree bark, as it may do damage to your rope and possibly the tree. Choose smaller trees or use tree branches to attach your hammock instead. Alternatively, you may purchase a pair of Extension Tree Straps, and attach these onto your first straps.
      the_suspension_rope_is_not_jammed_tight: The suspension rope is not jammed tight in the descender rings! When I sit into the hammock the rope will slide through and the hammock will go down to the ground.
      the_suspension_strings: The suspension strings of the hammock do not seem to be right anymore
      the_tree_straps_are_too_long: The tree straps are too long.
      the_tree_straps_are_too_short: The tree straps are too short.
      there_are_two_ways_to_deal_with_that: 'There are two ways to deal with that: Preferably, wrap the strap around the tree two or more times so that it is not too long anymore. Alternatively attach the descender rings directly on the straps. To do that, go through both rings just once and then through in between. This works fine but the handling is slightly more difficult.'
      there_is_a_warranty_period: There is a warranty period of 1 year after you receive the products against any defects in materials and workmanship. Email us and we'll repair or replace the products for free, but you'll have to cover all shipping costs.
      there_is_no_warranty: There is no warranty on the Suspension Ropes (including the straps), as it can wear and need replacement.
      they_may_be_twisted: They may be twisted, which can happen if one or both of the connector loops happen to get through in between the ridgeline and the hammock. Just untwist them by taking the hammock off its suspension cord and go through that same place with the connector loop the other way (see our tips and tricks video for this). If you can see the strings coming out of the connector loops / from underneath the string suspension protections sleeves in a straight row it is not twisted anymore.
      they_may_cause_the_fibers: They may cause the fibers within the architecture of the ropes to shift a little bit, but this is no damage. No fibers will be damaged / torn.
      this_can_happen_if_the_ropes: This can happen if the ropes have not been threaded correctly through the descender rings. Thread the rope anew, or do a quick fix by making a slippery hitch into the rope just below the descender rings to prevent the rope from sliding through.
      this_is_due_to_the_90_degree_design: This is due to the 90 Degree design; the hammock is not too short. It is normal that you gently touch its lids with your head and your feet, because the hammock usually shrinks to your body length automatically.
      this_issue_is_a_trade_off: This issue is a trade-off for keeping things simple. Do not use force, use both hands instead and maybe take off your body weight from the zipper area, and it won't be a problem.
      this_you_really_have_to_test_for_yourself: This you really have to test for yourself, as it depends very much on the sleeping bag and insulation you use, as well as your own sensitivity to coldness. I personally have stayed very warm in -10° C (14° F) nights with a good down sleeping bag and a half length Exped Down Mat together with my down jacket in the pad-sleeve. Other winter hammock campers can deal with a lot colder temperatures, but this requires advanced gear and skills.
      treat_the_fabric_with_repellant: Treat the fabric with repellant (test first in an inconspicuous place).
      try_to_find_a_separate_mosquito_net_product: Try to find a separate mosquito net product, enclosing the whole hammock all around.
      use_of_the_hammock_and_sleeping_camping_in_it: Use of the hammock and sleeping / camping in it
      we_do_repairs_if_possible: We do repairs if possible, for free or a small charge, but you'll have to absorb all shipping costs. Please send us an email first.
      we_know_this_sometimes_happens: We know this sometimes happens and apologize for it. We kindly ask you to carefully cut off these fibers with scissors. If you are really careful melt the fraying fringe a little bit with a fire lighter. Note, though, that fibers can catch fire very easily and then burn a hole into the fabric. Always cut the fibers off with scissors first.
      what_conditions_are_suited: What conditions are suited for overnight camping in the 90 Degree Hammock?
      whats_the_advantage_of_inserting_a_pad: What's the advantage of inserting a pad into the pad-sleeve, as opposed to just laying a pad inside the hammock?
      why_is_the_90_degree_hammock: Why is the 90 Degree Hammock not entirely straight / flat?
      yes_you_could_even_hang_it: Yes, you could even hang it on one single overhead point (still use both suspension ropes, though). Consider these points, however
      you_can_also_consider: You can also consider doing minor repairs yourself or ask a friend with a sewing machine, which might be easier and cheaper for you.
      you_can_easily_replace: You can easily replace our suspension ropes with another system (such as button hole cords, daisy chains or woopie slings combined with climbing grade carabiners), or just take off the descender rings and use an appropriate knot to hang the hammock.
      you_can_hand_wash_your_hammock: You can hand wash your hammock in lukewarm water using a mild detergent. You may dare to machine wash it on the delicate cycle, at 30° C or colder and with a mild detergent, but hand washing should be preferred as it is more gentle to the hammock. If machine washing, take particular care to prevent entanglement of the string suspension system. We recommend you strap / leash the two sides together. Air-dry thoroughly before storing.
      you_could_also_consider: You could also consider using a half length pad, because all you really need is to have your shoulders and your butt covered. Having a pad would make it more comfortable should you have to go to the ground occasionally.
      you_may_return_them: You may return them within one month after you receive them, if they do not have any signs of use or damages and are not dirty.
      you_might_want_to_shorten: You might want to shorten the ridgeline (bug-net featuring models only) by tightening the adjustable side and locking it in place with one or two slippery hitches.
      you_need_to_know_that_mosquitos: You need to know that mosquitos can bite through one layer of the Nylon fabrics we use. However, as soon as there is any second layer of fabric, such as the pad-sleeve, your sleeping bag or long sleeved clothes, they won't have a chance. Therefore, in colder climates mosquito bites are quite unlikely, since you would use a model with a pad-sleeve or some other insulation, a sleeping bag and probably long sleeved sleep wear anyway. In the unlikely event that you get bitten because any naked skin touches an area of the hammock that is only single layered (outside the pad-sleeve area) use long sleeved sleep wear.
      you_will_not_be_able_to_hang: You will not be able to hang the 90° Tarp-Tent, as it needs a spacing of a bit more than 2 m (6 ft) for a taut pitch.
      youll_have_to_pay_for_all_shipping: You'll have to pay for all shipping, but we'll gladly refund the purchasing price. In case of damages, soilings or signs of use we unfortunately can't refund your money, or only parts thereof, at our discretion.
      your_number_one_concern: Your number one concern will most likely be to stay warm. Use an appropriately rated sleeping bag, a pad and / or other insulating material (such as your down jacket and other clothes). Test if you are warm enough with the gear and insulation you have before you spend an entire night.

      the_90_degree_hammock_is_different: The 90 Degree Hammock is different from hammocks you know and a bit more complex; therefore you will have to learn just a few skills to make the most of it. What you get in return is superior comfort; and hardly will you want to return to a standard hammock ever again! Please carefully watch our know-how videos and read the manuals and FAQ to learn how to use the 90 Degree Hammock.

      a_few_things_you_need_to_know_about_taking_care: A few things you need to know about taking care of your hammock and tarp
      advanced_skills_are_required_html: Advanced skills are required if you want to safely hammock camp in the wilderness. Make yourself familiar with hammock camping before you head out. Study this website and the manual, try out the hammock in your backyard, and read the book %{the_ultimate_hang} or another book on hammock camping.
      as_a_ground_sheet: As a ground sheet you may use a piece of plastic foil, a footprint available in outdoor stores, your rain poncho or the like.
      attach_one_side_of_the_hammock: 'Attach one side of the hammock to the suspension ropes in the following way: Go around both descender rings twice and then around the first one only (so that the end of the rope goes through in between the two rings). Pull the hammock upwards, unsnap the second side of the hammock and repeat.'
      attach_the_released_side: Attach the released side onto the other side without twisting it, using the snaps underneath the ridge-line attachment webbing.
      avoid_overstraining_the_suspension_system: Avoid overstraining the suspension system. The suspension cords should always maintain an angle of 30 degrees or more to the horizontal axis. With flatter angles the strain on the system increases exponentially, and you'll have a hard time to release the descender rings afterwards.
      be_aware_that_certain_tree_species: Be aware that certain tree species, as well as large and old trees, can drop limbs all of a sudden and even without there being any wind or rain. Carefully choose safe trees for hanging.
      before_each_use_check_all_product_components: Before each use check all product components for wear, damages and aging. Replace and / or repair components if needed.
      before_you_take_down_the_hammock: Before you take down the hammock, pull down both string suspension system protecting sleeves and snap them on the hammock!
      carefully_sit_down: Carefully sit down in the center of the hammock and thoroughly test the security of the suspension before lying down. In a next step, check whether or not you sit or lie exactly in the center axis of the hammock. If not, adjust accordingly until the hammock hangs exactly level.
      check_if_the_suspension_strings: Check if the suspension strings are not twisted on either side. In case they are, remove the side of the hammock in question from the rope, untwist and hang again.
      choose_2_trees_beams_poles: Choose 2 trees, beams, poles or other structures ideally 2 to 5.5 m (6 to 18ft) apart as hanging points. One overhead beam or branch is fine also.
      do_not_apply_force_to_the_bug_net: Do not apply force to the bug-net – do not stretch the hammock by means of the bug-net, and do not lay your head onto it.
      do_not_apply_force_to_the_bug_net_zipper: Do not apply force to the bug-net zipper. Use both hands – one holding the slider, the other one the zipper tape – to open or close the zipper and get the slider around the curves.
      do_not_hang_the_hammock_high_above: Do not hang the hammock high above
      do_not_leave_your_90_degree_hammock: Do not leave your 90 Degree Hammock and Tarp-Tent out in the sun for extended periods. Any lightweight fabric will deteriorate with prolonged exposure to UV light.
      do_not_remove_the_ridgeline: Do not remove the ridgeline. It ensures the safe maximum span of the hammock can't be exceeded.
      each_time_before_lying_down: Each time before lying down, carefully sit into the hammock first and thoroughly test the stability and safety of the suspended hammock. Make sure the descender rings and suspension cords are correct and tidy. If you have any doubts or for additional security make a slippery hitch into the suspension ropes just after the descender rings.

      headline: 90° Hammocks Manual
      if_there_are_bugs: If there are bugs but no rain or dew, pitch your hammock on the ground as a bug bivy (using your hiking poles or two sticks, a total of 6 stakes and the two removable guy lines of the 90 Degree Tarp-Tent). The bug bivy is not exactly spacious, but you'll appreciate it if there are mosquitoes around (Gamma UL version with bug-bivy functionality only).
      if_there_is_no_rain: If there is no rain or dew and no bugs, cowboy camp with your sleeping bag.
      if_there_is_rain_or_dew: If there is rain or dew, pitch your 90 Degree Tarp-Tent using 2 hiking poles or sticks and cowboy camp inside.
      if_there_is_rain_or_dew_as_well_as_bugs: If there is rain or dew as well as bugs, pitch the Tarp-Tent and the hammock as a bug bivy (Gamma UL version only) inside of it (using the mitten hook on the ridge of the tarp to hang the bug-net, and the 4 main stakes of the Tarp-Tent as attachment points for the hammock shock cord loops).
      if_you_cant_find_anything: If you can't find anything you may consider going to the ground just like anyone with a tent (possibly using a ground sheet and a pad), in either of these ways
      initially_you_need_to_attach_the_descender_rings: Initially you need to attach the descender rings on the connector loops of the hammock if you are using our Hammock Suspension Ropes. Go through the connector loop with the free end of the continuous loop on which the descender rings are attached. Then go around the connector loop and through the continuous loop on the other side with the descender rings. Arrange everything tidily and pull it taut. See our product video on the Hammock Suspension Ropes for a visual demonstration.
      it_is_normal_that_stitching_holes: It is normal that stitching holes open up a little bit once the seams have been under pressure (aka seam slippage). This does not mean that the fabric is about to rip. It will retain 100% of its original strength, as the fibers are only shifted a bit within the architecture of the fabric and are not broken.
      lie_in_a_90_degree_angle: Lie in a 90 degree angle to the suspension axis of the hammock, not like you would in a normal hammock.
      look_out_for_other_hanging_opportunities: Look out for other hanging opportunities. It is very often possible to find alternative structures, such as posts, poles, cars, fences, boulders, beams and what not.
      make_sure_the_hammock_and_tarp: Make sure the hammock and tarp are always thoroughly dried out before you store them. If you had to pack them damp use the first opportunity to dry them out. Store them in a dry and dark place.
      not_before_the_hammock_is_hanged: Not before the hammock is hanged on both sides do you pull up the string suspension protecting sleeves to expose the suspension strings. Attach the pulled up protection sleeves by means of the snaps.
      packing_up_the_90_degree_hammock: Packing up the 90 Degree Hammock
      place_the_hammock: Place the hammock into the stuff bag or backpack. We recommend to neatly arrange the suspension string sleeves and ridgeline, for example by wrapping them around the hammock.
      pull_the_hammock: Pull the hammock to an appropriate height and both sides to the same level; and test if the descender rings are neatly arranged and have locked the cord securely.
      relax: Relax!
      retrieve_and_pack_the_suspension_ropes: Retrieve and pack the suspension ropes. It is suggested you make it a habit to always double check if you have packed them – it can be quite annoying if they're not to be found next time.
      take_off_the_other_side: Take off the other side from the suspension rope.
      take_one_side_of_the_hammock: Take one side of the hammock off the suspension rope. First, pull on the loose end of the rope or feed the other side back through the rings a little bit to loosen up the grip of the descender rings. Then spread them and unthread the end of the rope that goes through in between the rings. You can then just slide the rings down and off the rope.
      the_90_degree_hammock_is_not_designed: The 90 Degree Hammock is not designed for jumping in it or any other rough treatment. Please be gentle with it.
      the_hammock_has_a_distinct_head_and_foot_end: The hammock has a distinct head- and foot end and can therefore only be used in one direction. The entrance at the foot end is marked by our company logo.
      the_hammock_must_be_suspended_exactly_level: The hammock must be suspended exactly level; otherwise you will not lie in its center axis. Test this first (by sitting / lying in it) and adjust accordingly if needed (by lowering / raising one side or the other).
      to_enter_the_hammock: 'To enter the hammock, follow these 3 steps: 1.) sit down in its center, 2.) take your legs inside, and 3.) lower your upper body. If you don''t have a long pad inside you might have to spread out the hammock fabric before you can do step 3; do this on the fabric and not on the bug-net. Fine tune your position if needed (move right to the head end of the hammock).'
      to_exit_the_hammock: To exit the hammock, open the bug-net zipper, roll up the entrance door and tuck it between two strings, so that the door stays open and does not get in the way.
      unpack_the_hammock: Unpack the hammock and make sure the ridge-line and the two sleeves containing the suspension strings are not twisted or tangled. Have the foot side near you and determine where you'd like to have the entry of the hammock.
      using_a_long_pad_inside_the_pad_sleeve: Using a long pad inside the pad-sleeve gives you the most comfortable lay (while not necessarily being the lightest option for backpacking). To stay warm with pads thinner than 5 cm (2'') you may want to add a jacket or something underneath your butt area.
      using_a_small_pillow: Using a small pillow makes the hammock even more comfortable, particularly if you sleep on your side. Your jumper (sweater) works perfectly and can be formed both into a pillow for side sleeping and a neck roll for back sleeping.
      what_do_you_do_if_you_cant_find_any_trees: What do you do if you can't find any trees?
      wrap_the_straps_of_the_suspension_system: Wrap the straps of the suspension system

      get_the_two_main_guy_lines_on_the_ridge: Get the two main guy lines on the ridge of the Tarp-Tent around the tree trunk (or other structure) your hammock is hanged from (or will be hanged later, respectively). Just attach the end hooks onto the guy line itself to form a loop around the tree. Position the tarp above the hammock by tying the guy lines with the Line Locs.

      tie_down_the_other_four_guy_lines: Tie down the other four guy lines.
      to_prevent_guy_line_entanglements: 'To prevent guy line entanglements we recommend pulling one side of the guy lines through the Line Locs almost entirely and then winding them up (suggestion: with the figure 8 method and with the loop / hook end close to the Line Loc).'
      you_may_install_the_hammock: You may install the hammock (Gamma UL version only) inside the Tarp-Tent as an improvised bug bivy. Hang the bug-net shock cord onto the mitten hook lo-cated in the center of the tarp ridge, and attach the four hammock tie out shock cords to the 4 main wing stakes of the tarp. The suspension sleeves will lie loosely on the ground exposing the lower portion of the strings – take care not to tangle them.
    our_story:
      after_one_of_those_midnight_splashes: "...after one of those midnight splashes of cold rain water down our backs."
      all_our_products: 'All our products and components thereof are made in one or several of these countries: Indonesia, USA, China, European Union and Switzerland.'
      also_in_2012: 'Also in 2012 I quit my job as a Geologist and headed out on an epic adventure: A 4.5 month southbound thru hike of the 4''000 km (2''600 mile) long Pacific Crest Trail in the western United States. And obviously I spent the entire 4.5 months camping in a suspended Ergo Hammock every night except two. On the entire trip I slept incredibly well, felt very lucky, very comfortable and the opposite of jealous of everyone with a tent; but obviously I could not help but think about even more improvements that still seemed to be possible...'
      but_we_still_had_tasted: But, we still had tasted the sweet benefits of hammock camping and I could not get the concept out of my head. My brain started milling around on possible improvements and soon after I acquired a couple of old disused light-blue army parachutes to salvage fabric, bought a second hand sewing machine and started to come up with a new hammock model for each of our yearly summer biking or hiking trips across Europe.
      good_morning: Good morning and...
      good_night: "...good night in the Ergo Hammock, somewhere along the Pacific Crest Trail in 2012."
      hammocktent_gmbh_was_founded: HammockTent GmbH was founded in 2014 by Luke in his home country of Switzerland. However, our story began in 2005, when my adventure buddy reckoned we should take a couple of cheap hammocks instead of our crappy and moldy tent on a bicycle trip down to Croatia.
      headline: Our story
      i_got_to_know_him: I got to know him through unlikely circumstances and could win him as a collaborator and friend. And thus the 90 Degree Hammock may in fact represent a combination of Swiss engineering, Italian design and Indonesian workmanship. On the other hand, you might correctly assume that cultural differences between these three have posed a certain challenge at times.
      late_in_2013: Late in 2013, in agreement with Exped, I made the decision to give it a go myself. By autumn 2014, after all of my savings had been invested, several thousand or so emails been written, 3 months been spent in Indonesia and a lot of my friends and family had volunteered with various tasks, the unique 90 Degree Hammock is right here in stock and HammockTent.com up and running!
      on_the_way_to_croatia: On the way to Croatia in 2005...
      our_cuben_fiber_tarps: Our Cuben Fiber tarps are produced in the USA by an excellent cottage manufacturing contractor that has many years of experience in the production of Cuben Fiber outdoor gear.
      rest_assured: Rest assured that there is no child labor or inhuman working conditions whatsoever and that the hammocks are being manufactured by a few skilled and distinguished Indonesian tailors earning good money with it.
      somewhat_advanced_models: Somewhat advanced models, in action in...
      switzerland_and_norway: Switzerland and Norway, 2008.
      the_whole_project: The whole project could benefit from the great Italian artist, philosopher, designer and specialty hammock manufacturer Alberto, who – already in his 70ies – contributed a great deal and is carrying out the near impossible production of the 90 Degree Hammock on his Indonesian home island. He had in fact been tinkering with this kind of hammock design for 20 years and first developed it with Yucatan Indians in Mexico he spent some time with. By replacing some fabric of their traditional hammocks with strings he could improve the visibility from inside the hammock, and make it possible to hang them well hidden high up on some single branch of a tree.
      though_we_could_faintly_imagine: Though we could faintly imagine the potential of camping in hammocks, the trip was mainly a disaster, with us either freezing to near death or having rainwater running down our backs in the middle of the night, or both.
      upon_my_return_to_switzerland: Upon my return to Switzerland I fired up the sewing machine again, just to see that a lot of my ideas that seemed to be so perfect in my head in fact did not work out in reality, or were much more complicated than originally thought. However, I kept on tinkering and trying out ever new solutions, and ended up with what I called a 90 Degree Hammock. A design that was undoubtedly more comfortable and more versatile than anything I'd come up with before, and I reckoned it might be feasible to get it produced, if at great pains.
      years_later_in_2010: Years later in 2010 I thought that my latest model was actually not too bad, and I approached Swiss outdoor company Exped with it. After a lot of work this resulted in Exped's Ergo Hammock that won a design award at the Outdoor Trade Show in Friedrichshafen Germany in 2011, and was released in 2012.

      if_you_intend_to_camp_in_the_outdoors: If you intend to camp in the outdoors with the 90 Degree Hammock you may want to combine it with our high tech ultralight cuben fiber 90 Degree Tarp-Tent. It gives you protection from the rain and an area of shelter for cooking and arranging your gear.

      pad_sleeve_text_1: Pad-sleeve with a zippered foot-side opening and a zippered access from inside the hammock. Insert a camping pad and the 90 Degree Hammock will get ridiculously spacious, comfortable and warm!
      pad_sleeve_text_2: Bottom insulation is very important if you intend to sleep in a hammock. If you have ever spent a night in a hammock you will know that it can be very cold from underneath as soon as the temperature drops below 25 Degrees C (77 Degrees F) or so – a phenomenon known as the "cold butt syndrome" by hammock campers. This is due to the fact that your sleeping bag is com-pressed below your body and thus does not offer any insulation, as well as the fact that any body heat is instantly gone with the wind (wind chill).

      the_90_degree_hammock_is_unique: 'The 90 Degree Hammock is unique in that you lie in a right angle (90 degrees) to the suspension axis of the hammock. This makes for a super comfortable recline and sleeping with a flat lay, even on your side! It solves two age old hammock design issues that may be holding some people back from using hammocks altogether: The banana lay and the cold back, which can be a challenge in colder areas. And, it is guaranteed no tip!'

Over the last decade or so it has become the material of choice for thru-hikers and ultralight backpackers.
