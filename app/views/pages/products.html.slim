  p The ultralight 90 Degree Hammock is unique in that you lie at a right angle (90 degrees) to the suspension axis of the hammock. This enables a flat lay for very comfortable sleeping, even on your side. A slack double layer, called "pad-sleeve", lets you use your camping pad or some other stuff to insulate your bottom. Combined with our state-of-the-art 90 Degree Tarp-Tent it's an all around shelter system for camping pretty much everywhere, even without any trees.
