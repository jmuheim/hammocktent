      if_you_intend_to_camp_in_the_outdoors: If you intend to camp in the outdoors with the 90 Degree Hammock you may want to combine it with our high tech ultralight cuben fiber 90 Degree Tarp-Tent. It gives you protection from the rain and an area of shelter for cooking and arranging your gear. The 90 Degree Tarp-Tent features doors that can be rolled down for all around protection in the event of stormy weather and for pitching it as a tent on the ground with two hiking poles or sticks.
      the_90_degree_hammock_comes_in_several_versions: The 90 Degree Hammock comes in several versions for many different purposes and preferences; and can be combined with our state of the art ultralight 90 Degree Tarp-Tent. This converts the hammock into an all around shelter system for camping pretty much everywhere, even without any trees!
      the_90_degree_hammock_is_unique: 'The 90 Degree Hammock is unique in that you lie in a 90 degree angle to the suspension axis of the hammock. This makes for a super comfortable recline and sleeping with a flat lay, even on your side! It solves two age old hammock design issues that may be holding some people back from using hammocks altogether: The banana lay and the cold back, which can be a challenge in colder areas. And, it is guaranteed no tip!'
